# Hyx: console hex editor
A minimalistic (&lt; 2100 lines of C) but powerful (hex/ASCII, insert/replace/delete, copy/paste, undo/redo, search, colors, vim-inspired controls) Linux console hex editor

This is a fork of the original code by Lorenz Panny that adds support for Mac OSX. Tested on El Capitan (10.11.6).

# Getting started
Build the binary of Hyx by running `make`. Test Hyx, run `./hyx hyx` to open the Hyx binary into Hyx. To see all available options, run `./hyx --help`.
